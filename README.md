# Installation
You will need to have node.js installed on your computer, as well as the inquirer package.
# Usage
Make sure to first open your terminal and type npm install, then once dependencies are installed type npm init -y. After this is done you should be able to follow the on screen instructions, when you reach the final step you will be greeted by a "success" notification. Now you should have a README file that looks great and can be copied into a repository of your choice.
